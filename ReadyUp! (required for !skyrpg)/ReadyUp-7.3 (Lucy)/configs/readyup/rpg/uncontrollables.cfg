//		ABILITY TRIGGERS:

//		SURVIVOR EFFECTS:



//		Common Infected and Witches create auras.
//		These auras can slow, hurt, or cause other effects - like bean-bag, to players caught within them.
//		Auras stack, too, which can make them deadly.

//		To counter Auras, Survivors will be given Pets. Pets can stack, too.
