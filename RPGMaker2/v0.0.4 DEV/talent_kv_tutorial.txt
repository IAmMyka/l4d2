I will get this updated in another commit, but for now, what's here are all of the keys used to create a talent.
Due to the amount of possible keys, it's better to just omit the ones you don't need when creating a talent
and the software will automatically create (for sorting reasons) the key and push the default value.

Default value = ignores key.

Until I can fill this in, if you need to create talents, please reference the talentmenu.cfg for legends on each key
though the key name should (hopefully) be self-explanatory.
