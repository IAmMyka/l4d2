this repo contains RPG v4.85, compiled on 10/31/2019
there is an optional metamod component that is not included on this repo.

database is required.
must be compiled using SM 1.8 or earlier. Is not compatible with newer compilers due to deprecated functions that I have not updated.
Trying to compile with later versions will yield huge fucking errors in your compiler, and i will laugh at you if you post about it on the thread.

todo: currently adding in a robust API for skyenet to have more control over... everything?
