// NOTE: the following chars are SELF-DEFINED by the user - it's important to make sure
//		 a talent exists with whatever char you decide to use, or it won't do anything!
//		 Customization comes at a price.

// survivor_client_triggers
// a	- this is linked to the survivor shield ability i created.

// infected_client_triggers
// a	- this is linked to the infected repercussions ability. (chance to make the survivor explode)


// Game Events - http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Left_4_Dead_2_Events
// For each event, find and match the keys (left) with the values (right).
// All available keys are provided in the sample player_death event
// keys defined by event_ are core plugin-specific triggers.

// addon_plugin - Yup, this key gets its own paragraph, yippy!
// the rpg this plugin is based on had so many dependencies, and it looked pretty disgusting.
// in this rpg, if you want a talent to require a specific plugin, simply enter a value other than -1.
// Doing this results in a forward firing, providing important event variables, as well as the addon_plugin name.
// The name is important so if multiple addon plugins exist that they only do things with that specific string that
// is sent to them.
// This lets a developer add their own talent combinations, or whatever else they can think of. accessibility, i guess.

// survivor_flags & infected_flags
// I see it often requested to allow server operators to use user access flags (reserve, root, etc.) to access
// anything and everything. now you can attach that to requirements for triggering abilities, or even acknowledging
// events, or... for even determining which of those datas are sent through forwards. i'm confused, too, don't worry.
