/*

	Special Infected and Survivors have a new 'Speciality' that allows them to enable an additional ability, such as a healing-aura that lasts a certain
	amount of time and then eventually disappears. Or, floating orbs that may follow you around and occasionally zap your enemies.
	Or an awesome energy shield. You know what, the possibilities are endless.
