// Perks can only be obtained through Discovery Items.
// Perks have a duration until they expire, and the only other way to remove them is to pay for it with store points.
// Some perks have positive effects, some have potentially negative or unsettling ones. You can create any perk you want, with any combination of effects, but
// some might not work well, together, so keep that in mind.

// Triggers:
//
// "r"			- when a survivor player revives a fallen teammate
// "d"			- when a player damages a player on the opposing team

// Effects:
//
// "h"			- heals the player who holds the perk
// "H"			- heals the player the perk holder has targeted
// "u"			- hurts the player the perk holder has targeted
// "t"			- adds temporary health to the player who holds the perk
